Each cpp file tests one function of the chess program.
The results of the tests have been piped through tee to file using the same filename as the test cpp file.
To display these .Result files use cat [filename] and the colour codes will be converted to chess boards in the terminal.
Otherwise please compile tests if you wish to test the game's functions yourself.

makefile for tests will be included later.
